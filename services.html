                    <p>Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods,
                        processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights
                        from structured and unstructured data. Data science is the same
                        concept as data mining and big data: "use the most powerful hardware,
                        the most powerful programming systems, and the most efficient
                        algorithms to solve problems"<br> <br>
                        "Data science" has recently become a popular term among business executives.
                        However, many critical academics and journalists see no distinction between
                        data science and statistics, whereas others consider it largely a popular
                        term for "data mining" and "big data".
                        Writing in Forbes, Gil Press argues that data science is a buzzword without
                        a clear definition and has simply replaced "business analytics" in contexts
                        such as graduate degree programs</p>
